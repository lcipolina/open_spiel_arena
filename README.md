# Project: OpenSpiel LLM Arena

## 0. Project Goal
The goal of this project is to evaluate the decision-making capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by engaging them in simple games implemented using Google's OpenSpiel framework. The LLMs can play against:
1. A random bot.
2. Another LLM.
3. Themselves (self-play).

This project explores how LLMs interpret game states, make strategic decisions, and adapt their behavior through natural language prompts.

## 1. How to Run

### Prerequisites
1. **Python Environment**:
   - Python 3.7 or higher.
   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Install OpenSpiel Framework**:
   - Clone and set up OpenSpiel from its official repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel.git
     cd open_spiel
     ./install.sh
     ```

3. **Project Setup**:
   - Clone this repository:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     cd <repository-folder>
     pip3 install -e .
     ```

### Running the Simulator

1. Use the main binary to run simulations:
   - To simulate a single game:
     ```bash
      # From a JSON FILE
      python scripts/simulation.py --config config.json

      # Run with default config (Tic-Tac-Toe, 5 rounds)
      python3 scripts/simulate.py

      # Human vs LLM
      python3 scripts/simulate.py --game tic_tac_toe --player-types human llm --player-models None gpt2

      # Random Bot vs LLM (Connect Four)
      python3 scripts/simulate.py --game connect_four --player-types random_bot llm --player-models flan-t5

      # Self-Play Tournament (10 rounds)
      python3 scripts/simulate.py --game kuhn_poker --player-types llm llm --player-models gpt2 distilgpt2 --rounds 10

      # Multi-Game Challenge
      python3 scripts/simulate.py --games tic_tac_toe prisoners_dilemma connect_four --rounds 5
     ```

2. Command-line options:
   - `--games`: Specify one or more games to simulate.
   - `--player-types`: Specify the types of players participating in the game. Acceptable values are `human`, `random_bot`, or `llm`. Provide one type per player, separated by spaces.
   - `--player-models`: Specify the LLM models to use for players marked as `llm`. Provide one model per player, separated by spaces. Use `None` for non-LLM players.
   - `--rounds`: Number of rounds to simulate for each game (default: 1).

## 2. Directory Structure

### Packages
- **`games/`**: Game loaders.
- **`simulators/`**: Simulator logic for each game.
- **`utils/`**: Shared utility functions (e.g., prompt generation, LLM integration).

### Results
- **`results/`**: Stores the JSON files with simulation results.

### Binary
- **`scripts/run_simulation.py`**: The main script to run simulations. This is the entry point for the project.

### Tests
- **`tests/`**: Unit tests for utilities and simulators.

### Game Registry
- **`games_registry.py`**: Centralized file for managing all available games and their simulators.

---

## 3. Games Available

### List of Supported Games
1. **Tic-Tac-Toe**:
   - A classic 3x3 grid game where players aim to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

2. **Python Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma**:
   - A repeated strategy game where players choose between cooperation and defection to maximize rewards over multiple rounds.

3. **Connect Four**:
   - A two-player game where players drop colored discs into a 7x6 grid, aiming to connect four of their own discs in a line.

4. **Matrix Rock-Paper-Scissors**:
   - A variant of RPS represented as a payoff matrix.

5. **Matrix Prisoner’s Dilemma**:
   - A matrix version of Prisoner’s Dilemma, emphasizing strategic interactions between players.

6. **Kuhn Poker**:
   - A simplified poker game with limited betting rounds and a small deck.

7. **Matching Pennies (3-player)**:
   - A three-player game where each player aims to match or mismatch the choices of others to achieve a payoff.

## 4. Adding a New Game
To add a new game to the OpenSpiel LLM Arena, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Implement the Game Loader
1. Create a new entry for the game in the **`games/loaders_module`** script.
   - For example, to add **Matching Pennies**:
     - Create:
       ```python
       def get_matching_pennies_game():
           from open_spiel.python.games import matching_pennies
           return matching_pennies.MatchingPenniesGame()
       ```

### Step 2: Implement the Game Simulator
2. Create a corresponding simulator file in the **`simulators/`** folder.
   - The simulator should inherit from the base `GameSimulator` class.

### Step 3: Register the Game
3. Add the new game to the **`games_registry.py`** file.
   - Example:
     ```python
     from games.matching_pennies import get_matching_pennies_game
     from simulators.matching_pennies_simulator import MatchingPenniesSimulator

     GAMES_REGISTRY["matching_pennies"] = {
         "loader": get_matching_pennies_game,
         "simulator": MatchingPenniesSimulator,
         "display_name": "Matching Pennies",
     }
     ```

### Step 4: Run the New Game
4. Use the `run_simulation.py` script to test the new game. Example:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/run_simulation.py --games matching_pennies
   ```

## 5. Features

- **LLM Integration**:
  - Uses Hugging Face Transformers to incorporate open-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-2, FLAN-T5).
  - Converts game states into natural language prompts for LLM decision-making.

- **Flexible Opponent Options**:
  - LLMs can play against random bots, other LLMs, or themselves.

- **Extensible Framework**:
  - Supports adding new OpenSpiel games by defining custom simulators and integrating them into the pipeline.

- **Results Logging**:
  - Saves simulation results in JSON format inside the `results/` folder for easy analysis and review.
